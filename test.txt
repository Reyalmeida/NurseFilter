[TEST WORKFLOW]

Test #1: Functionality of CombineDataCommand

setUp Method:

The setUp method creates mock data to simulate the two Excel sheets (database_data and medicaid_data). These dataframes are used to mimic the real data for testing.
This method is automatically called before each test case (in this case, before test_combine_data) to ensure fresh data is provided for every test run.
Mock Data:

self.mock_db_data simulates the hospital or database Excel sheet, containing child names, birthdates, and parent information.
self.mock_medicaid_data simulates the Medicaid data, containing mother and child information, along with extra details like addresses and phone numbers.
Mock App Object:

A MockApp class is created to simulate the app that stores the combined data. This is important because the CombineDataCommand expects an app object to store the result after the merge. The MockApp has a single attribute combined_data, which is set by the CombineDataCommand.
test_combine_data Method:

The core of the test happens here:
Step 1: The test starts by printing out messages to give context about the ongoing actions.
Step 2: The CombineDataCommand is instantiated with the mock data and the mock app object.
Step 3: The command is executed by calling command.execute(), which triggers the data combination process.
Step 4: Assertions are used to check if the combined data is not None and to ensure the data was properly combined (i.e., the result should have two rows because both mock datasets contain two matching records).
Step 5: The test checks if the expected columns exist in the combined dataset (i.e., Mother_First_Name, Child_First_Name, etc.).

The final step prints the combined data and confirms that the test has passed.
What Makes This a Proper Unit Test:
Isolated:

The test focuses purely on the functionality of the CombineDataCommand. It doesn't involve any GUI elements or external dependencies, such as actual file dialogs or Excel files, making it self-contained and fast.
Mocking:

The test uses mock dataframes instead of reading actual files, which keeps the test isolated from external file dependencies. This is a best practice in unit testing, as it ensures the test isn't dependent on file I/O or external data sources.
Assertions:

Proper assertions (self.assertIsNotNone, self.assertEqual, self.assertIn) are used to verify the expected behavior:
The combined data must not be None.
The number of rows in the combined data should be correct.
The combined data should have the expected columns.
Logs and Print Statements:

Print statements and logging help you understand the step-by-step progress and visualize the output. While not strictly necessary for unit tests, they can be helpful during the development phase or debugging.

Reproducibility:

The test can be run repeatedly without changes, and it will always yield consistent results since the data is mocked and controlled.
