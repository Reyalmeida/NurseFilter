Customer Feedback
User interface: Added new functions(affordances in place).
•	Added report feature for reporting which nurses are assigned to which children
•	Added batch_Assign function to assign families by City and zipcodes
•	Added Duplicate function to find duplications of families on list.
      To do:
•	More testing is required for batch_Assign, Although zipcode, city are available, it serves no purpose since these categories are not available on the combined list and therefore not present on main window.
•	The client has asked to add zip code, Address, phone numbers, as part of the categories.
•	Duplicate function works, The Director of Nurses requires some way to flag the first time those duplicates have been found.
•	The added Report feature works for one nurse and displays the assigned nurse for the given family. However, it would be good to include the categories mentioned above to the children profile.
•	Add a function to open an old combine list excel file to identify assigned Nurses.
Filter list: Options are in process.
