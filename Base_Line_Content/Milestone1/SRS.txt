1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose
       This document outlines the software requirements for the Excel Data Combiner 
       Application, designed to merge and manage hospital and Medicaid datasets.

   1.2 Scope
       The system will provide functionality to read, combine, and manage Excel 
       files containing healthcare data, with features for nurse assignment and 
       data security.

2. Functional Requirements

   2.1 Excel File Management

             - Child's Date of Birth
             Test: Verify records with matching criteria are combined correctly.

       FR2.2: The system shall identify and store unmatched records separately.
             Test: Verify unmatched records are saved to 'unmatched_data.xlsx'.

       FR2.3: The system shall identify and store duplicate records separately.
             Test: Verify duplicate records are saved to 'duplicate_names.xlsx'.

   2.3 Data Display and Search
       FR3.1: The system shall display combined data in a sortable table format.
             Test: Verify data is displayed and can be sorted by columns.

       FR3.2: The system shall provide search functionality by:
             - Mother ID
             - Child Name
             - Date of Birth
             Test: Verify search returns correct results for each criterion.

   2.4 Nurse Assignment
       FR4.1: The system shall allow individual nurse assignment to children.
             Test: Verify nurses can be assigned to individual children.

       FR4.2: The system shall support batch nurse assignment based on:
             - City
             - State
             - ZIP Code
             Test: Verify batch assignment works for specified criteria.

   2.5 Data Security
       FR5.1: The system shall encrypt sensitive data files.
             Test: Verify files are properly encrypted when saved.

       FR5.2: The system shall decrypt files when accessed with proper credentials.
             Test: Verify encrypted files can be decrypted for viewing.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

       NFR1.1: The system shall load Excel files (size â‰¤ 10MB) within 5 seconds.
               Test: Time file loading operations.

       NFR1.2: The system shall complete data combination within 10 seconds.
               Test: Measure data combination execution time.

   3.2 Usability
       NFR2.1: The system shall provide clear error messages for all error states.
               Test: Verify error messages are displayed for various error conditions.

       NFR2.2: The system shall maintain consistent UI layout across all windows.
               Test: Verify UI elements maintain position and style.

   3.3 Reliability
       NFR3.1: The system shall handle invalid data formats without crashing.
               Test: Input invalid data formats and verify graceful handling.

       NFR3.2: The system shall maintain data integrity during encryption/decryption.
               Test: Verify data remains unchanged after encryption/decryption cycle.

   3.4 Security
       NFR4.1: The system shall use industry-standard encryption (Fernet).
               Test: Verify encryption implementation meets standards.

       NFR4.2: The system shall not store encryption keys in plaintext.
